        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>When I started my adventure with online marketing, the world of advertising was completely different than today. All of us have been learning how to work with small businesses. We tested different solutions.</p>
        <p>How should a website look like? What kind of technology should we choose? 
         Today we know answers to these questions, they are obvious. But they haven’t been obvious before.Soon I realized that I wasn’t able to do everything by myself. I met cool guys (Graphic designer and Developer) and for 10 years we’ve been working together on different projects (I was the Marketing guy). Each of us had other projects as well, we worked as freelancers.On the other hand, we contributed to building some of the biggest e-commerce businesses in their niches, we changed small businesses into huge, national companies and some of them go public now. We are now experts in our field.</p>
